# DataBox
The DataBox is a free FileMaker plugin that allows creating and manipulating of data in computer memory. You can store data like variables, arrays, tables or any hierarchical structures and manipulate them.

As opposed to FileMaker global variables (like $$name) the data is stored in memory in correct FileMaker format like number, text, date, time or timestamp.

As the DataBox stores all data in memory, it works very fast. You can get data from your database (ex. from ExecuteSQL functions ) once and then work with it in memory.

The DataBox has powerful functions for manipulating, aggregating and getting data in different formats like JSON or interactive html-table.
